# Midi Clearone Control
Control Clearone Converge DSP from any Midi device.

Tested with:
  TouchOSC with TouchOSC Bridge
  Behringer BCF2000
  icon i-controls Pro

Fully configurable in midi.xml - see Clearone Midi Controller XML Configuration.docx for info on how to configure.

Could fairly easily be modifed to control any device that accepts telnet commands by midi.
